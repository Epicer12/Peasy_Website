                    Building a PC is supposed to be the ultimate gaming rite of passage, but for most, it's a stressful nightmare.
                    You spend hours researching parts only to worry about compatibility. You stare at confusing manuals, terrified
                    that one wrong plug will fry your expensive components. And when you finally press the power button and nothing
                    happens? You're left alone in the dark, scrolling through 20 browser tabs of conflicting advice, trying to
                    decipher beep codes and debug LEDs. It shouldn't be this hard.
